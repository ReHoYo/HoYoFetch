title: Manual moderation
description: Ban, kick, mute, purge, release, confirmation, cleanup, and undo behavior.
---

All manual actions require an active Irminsul audit channel.

## Writing a command

Every manual action takes one member and a reason written in plain words. The member, the reason,
and any option may appear in any order:

```text
/Ban @member for spamming and stuff
/Mute 1h @member because they argued with staff
/Ban @member delete:1d reason: raid cleanup
```

The last form is the older delimiter syntax; it is still accepted. A reason is always required.
Bare option words such as `1h` or `29d` are only read as options while they come before the reason —
once the reason starts, everything that follows is part of it, so `/Mute @member for arguing for 3d
straight` opens the duration picker and keeps the sentence intact.

## Confirm before acting

Because the reason is free text, a mistyped or auto-completed mention would otherwise be
indistinguishable from the intended member. `/Ban`, `/Kick`, and `/Mute` therefore post a
confirmation that names the action, the target, the reason, and any typed cleanup window:

```text
🔨 Confirm Ban
Action: ban
Target: @member
Reason: spamming and stuff
```

Nothing is sent to Stoat until the moderator who ran the command reacts ✅. Another moderator's
reaction is ignored, ❌ cancels without touching the member, and the prompt expires after two
minutes. Permissions and the target are verified at that point, not when the command was typed, so
the checks reflect the moment of the action.

## Ban

```text
/Ban @member for repeated spam
```

After ✅, `/Ban` verifies Ban Members and acts. Once the ban lands, Irminsul offers a cleanup
picker: 1️⃣ 1h · 2️⃣ 6h · 3️⃣ 1d · 4️⃣ 3d · 5️⃣ 7d · 6️⃣ 14d · 7️⃣ 29d, or ❌ to keep the messages.
Only the moderator who ran the command can choose, and the picker expires after two minutes.
Cleanup requires Manage Messages in every affected channel.

The protected record accepts a ↩️ reaction for ten minutes from a freshly authorized ban moderator.
Undo unbans the account but cannot restore membership or deleted messages.

## Kick

```text
/Kick @member for raiding
```

After ✅, `/Kick` verifies Kick Members and acts, then offers the same cleanup picker. A kick
cannot be undone by the bot; the member needs a new invite to return.

## Mute

```text
/Mute @member 1h cooldown
/Mute @member for arguing with staff
```

Supported durations are `10m`, `30m`, `1h`, `4h`, `24h`, `3d`, and `7d`. A typed duration goes
through the ✅/❌ confirmation. Omitting the duration opens a two-minute picker for the command
invoker instead — choosing from it is already a deliberate second act, so no separate confirmation
follows. Either way the cleanup picker comes after the timeout is applied. The protected record
offers a ten-minute ↩️ release window to freshly authorized timeout moderators.

## Purge observed messages

```text
/Purge-User @member because of spam
```

`/Purge-User` asks for a window with the same 1h–29d picker, then reports how many observed messages
match and waits for a ✅/❌ confirmation. Both steps are invoker-only and expire after two minutes.
Only one purge or cleanup runs per server at a time.

Only messages recorded by Irminsul can be selected. Protected audit entries, retained evidence,
quotations, reactions, and external copies are not erased.

## Release and reset automod history

```text
/Automod release @member false positive
```

This removes a native timeout, resets the member's automod strike history, and closes pending ban
reviews for the containment. It can also release a manually applied timeout. It is the one manual
action with no confirmation step, because it only restores access.

:::caution[History cleanup is best-effort]
Cleanup reaches back 29 days, one day short of the 30-day message archive that feeds it. Stoat's ban
route has no message-history option and its bulk-delete route accepts only recent messages, so
Irminsul bulk-deletes archived IDs from the last seven days and removes anything older one message
at a time. A single cleanup deletes at most 2,000 messages, oldest first; every response and audit
record states how many were selected, deleted, failed, and left for a follow-up run.
